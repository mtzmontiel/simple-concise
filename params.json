Even if my apps are on production environments there are things that always have to bee time after time; normal things, weird things, required things and absolutely wasteful things. Some of them are simple enough but time consuming others are really hard and once there is a clear path they must be done just on a operational service window with high risk of failure.\r\n\r\n# What\r\n\r\nThere are quite a lot of things that need to be done, for now I will enumerate in no particular order. At a later time this will be revised, reduced and prioritized\r\n\r\n* Basic UI\r\n* Security\r\n* Event Log (business wise)\r\n* Rest API\r\n* Validation\r\n* Localization\r\n* End user documentation\r\n* Sysadmin documentation\r\n* App mantainer documentation\r\n\r\n# How\r\n\r\nHere I will try and probably fail (more likely abandon) to solve some of that problems with my particular point of view and restrictions. I still don't know at the time of writing what will I develop, it could be a framework allows to constraint such tasks, a tool that simplifies things or perhaps document existings tools and frameworks that allow to reduce time waste.\r\n\r\n# When\r\n\r\nWhenever I have some spare time which is why I presume this will fail and flail","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
