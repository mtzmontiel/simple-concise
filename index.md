Why
===

For some time I have been redoing the same tasks one time after
another and never quite getting things done. Even if my apps are
on production environments there are things are inevitable; normal things, 
weird things, required things and absolutely wasteful things. Some of them 
are simple enough but time consuming others are really hard and once there 
is a clear path they must be done just on a operational service window with
high risk of failure.

Note that this is currently a work in progress, you can find info on updates
<a href="{{site.url}}/updates.html">here</a>.

What
====

There are quite a lot of things that need to be done, for now I
will enumerate them in no particular order. At a later time this
will be revised, reduced and prioritized.

* Basic UI
* Security
* Event Log (business wise)
* Rest API
* Validation
* Localization
* End user documentation
* Sysadmin documentation
* App mantainer documentation

How
===

Here I will try and probably fail (more likely abandon) to solve
some of that problems with my particular point of view and
restrictions. I still don't know at the time of writing this what
will I develop, it could be a framework allows to constraint
such tasks, a tool that simplifies things or perhaps I will just 
document existings tools and frameworks that allow to reduce
the waste of time.

When
====

Whenever I have some spare time which is why I presume this will
fail and flail.
