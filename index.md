Why
===

For some time I have been redoing the same tasks one time after another and never quite getting things done. Even if my apps are on production environments there are things that always have to bee time after time; normal things, weird things, required things and absolutely wasteful things. Some of them are simple enough but time consuming others are really hard and once there is a clear path they must be done just on a operational service window with high risk of failure.

What
====

There are quite a lot of things that need to be done, for now I will enumerate in no particular order. At a later time this will be revised, reduced and prioritized

* Basic UI
* Security
* Event Log (business wise)
* Rest API
* Validation
* Localization
* End user documentation
* Sysadmin documentation
* App mantainer documentation

How
===

Here I will try and probably fail (more likely abandon) to solve some of that problems with my particular point of view and restrictions. I still don't know at the time of writing what will I develop, it could be a framework allows to constraint such tasks, a tool that simplifies things or perhaps document existings tools and frameworks that allow to reduce time waste.

When
====

Whenever I have some spare time which is why I presume this will fail and flail.
